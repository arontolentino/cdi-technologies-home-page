# Project #1: CDI Technologies Home Page

For my first projects as part of the $100 coding bootcamp, I decide to recreate the homepage of CDI Technologies I built on WordPress a few months ago. CDI is one of the largest IT providers in the EdTech space and I had the priveledge to lead the project of redesigning their corporate website as their Web Systems Administrator. I figured it would be easier to work with a design I'm already familliar with to kick things off. 

Taking into account the business requirements and stakeholders of CDI's website, I decided to build the site on WordPress with the lightweight Astra theme and Elementor page builder. This WordPress stack is pretty common these days along with using other page builders such Divi, Visual Composer, and Beaver Builder that enable a customized front-end experience without having to write a single line of code. 

No page builders this time! I'm going to use the HTML and vanilla CSS skills I gained from finishing the [first course](https://www.udemy.com/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) from the $100 coding bootcamp curriculum and coding along the [Omnifood landing page](https://arontolentino.github.io/omnifood-landing-page).

## Wireframing

I recreated a simplified version of the homepage using balsamiq and will develop the page section by section.
